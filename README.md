# Fake News Detection

![Project Logo](link-to-your-image.png)

## Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing Machine Learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, to detect fake news articles from genuine ones. The aim is to create a model that can classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content and features.

## Features

- Collects a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake.
- Preprocesses the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
- Extracts relevant features from the text data, such as TF-IDF scores.
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier on the processed data.
- Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:** Gather a labeled dataset containing both real and fake news articles. This dataset will be used to train and test the model.

2. **Preprocessing:** Use the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text data for training. This involves removing irrelevant elements, converting text to lowercase, and tokenization.

3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features from the preprocessed text data. Common methods include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which captures the importance of words in the dataset.

4. **Model Training:** Train a Logistic Regression classifier using the extracted features and corresponding labels from the dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step will give you insights into how well the model is performing on both real and fake news articles.

6. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the authenticity of new news articles.

## Conclusion

The Fake News Detection Project showcases the application of Machine Learning, specifically Logistic Regression, in identifying fake news articles. By preprocessing and extracting features from text data, we were able to train a model that shows promising results in distinguishing between real and fake news. This project highlights the potential of using Machine Learning techniques to address real-world challenges in the domain of news authenticity and information integrity.
